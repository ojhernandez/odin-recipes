Odin Project Basic Recipe Site

Introduction:

This repository is going to be a basic recipe site made for the Odin Project's early Foundations lesson.

The site will not necessarily be pretty but will be a good practice for HTML basics. This project will be revisited later when I have a better understanding of CSS and then it can be more aesthetically pleasing.
